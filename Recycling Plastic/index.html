There are plenty ways for recycling plastic</figcaption>
    <div  id="tribute-info"><p class="info">Approximately over 100,000 marine animals die because of this plastic entanglement each year. Over 100 million plastic bottles are used and discarded every day, with 80% of them simply becoming non-biodegradable litter. While it is convenient to consume drinks straight out of plastic bottles, the trash that is accumulated in the process takes a huge toll on the health of our environment. Plastic water bottles have a significant carbon footprint, with the amount of water going into making a bottle being up to three times what’s inside the bottle. Therefore the plastic is very unhealthy for our environment. So for recycling plastic do the following steps: First, depolymerization is the step of transfer a polymer in a mixture of monomers. Second, thermal depolymerization is a depolymerization step using hydrous pyrolysis for the reduction of complex organic materials (often waste products of various sorts, often biomass and plastic) in a light crude oil.Third, the heat compression process have taken all unsorted, cleaned plastic in all forms, from soft plastic bags to hard industrial waste.
The Applications in plastics tybes. (PET) are recycled to reuse the material out of which they are made and to reduce the amount of waste going to landfills. (PVC) is a thermoplastic polymer. (HDPE) The most-often recycled plastic. (HDPE) came from petroleum. (Other plastics)The white plastic foam peanuts used as packing material are often accepted by shipping stores for use it again.Finlly Example Items Recycling,Recycle Plastic Bags. Recycle Plastic Coat Hangers. Recycle Plastic Bottles .Recycle All Other Plastic Waste.</p>
